# LoveBud Scout Live Provider Readiness Audit

## Baseline

## Endpoint Live Error Readiness Audit (slice update)

- endpoint error readiness audit added (`docs/product/lovebud-scout-live-endpoint-error-readiness-audit.md`)
- error taxonomy, safe-fail wiring, DI, and observability are aligned
- runtime Firebase / KV / provider API work remains blocked
- runtime dependency adapter skeleton (mock-disabled, no external calls) is the next recommended slice
- endpoint default remains stub
- UI default remains `local_stub`
- `tests/contracts/scout-live-endpoint-error-readiness-audit-contract.test.cjs` — focused error readiness audit

## Endpoint Live Error Taxonomy Contract (slice update)

- `verifyScoutLiveAuthBoundary` / `checkScoutLiveRateLimitBoundary` wrappers expose injected `verifyToken` / `checkRateLimit`


- **current main HEAD**: `6afb0aa5`
- **related issue**: #1882 (PRODUCT: Explore LoveBud Scout link-based fan assistant MVP)
- **Browse #1661** remains out of scope
- **open PR count**: 0
- **current live provider status**: provider-specific adapter selection boundary added; provider-specific adapter skeleton added behind disabled mode; no provider API call; staging_live and production_live remain blocked

## Audit Purpose

- 실제 provider/API key를 넣기 전에 readiness를 점검한다.
- 지금까지 구현한 boundary가 live integration을 감당할 수 있는지 본다.
- 이번 문서는 구현이 아니라 audit이다.
- default live AI usage는 여전히 금지다.

- **Ready for a narrow implementation slice**: Yes, with restrictions.
- **Ready for production/default live usage**: No.
- **Ready for frontend default endpoint_client**: No.

|---|---|---|
| No frontend API key | Pass | endpoint client/source selector tests |
| Default source remains local_stub | Pass | source selector tests |
| Endpoint default remains stub | Pass | endpoint tests |
| No real provider SDK import | Pass | adapter tests |
| No fetch/external source retrieval | Pass | guardrail tests |
| No auto-save | Pass | draft/save guardrails |

| Output safety filter applied | Pass | #2248 tests |
| Logging excludes prompt/PII/secrets | Pass | #2244 tests |
| Timeout/retry bounded | Pass | #2246 tests |

## Still Not Ready / Blockers

1. **Firebase auth verification is still placeholder only** — `verifyScoutFirebaseToken()` is a TODO comment in `suggest.js`. Without real Firebase Admin SDK integration, there is no way to authenticate users or associate suggestion requests with accounts.

2. **Persistent rate-limit storage is still placeholder only** — `checkScoutRateLimit()` is a TODO comment. Without persistent storage (KV, Durable Objects, D1), rate limits cannot be enforced across requests.

3. **Real provider adapter implementation does not exist** — The adapter skeleton exists, but no real provider SDK integration, prompt execution, or response parsing is implemented. Only mock executor paths exist.

4. **Provider-specific secret management process is not implemented** — No documented process for how provider API keys will be injected, rotated, or audited in production.

5. **Staging feature-flag rollout process is not fully defined** — How `endpoint_client` or live mode is enabled in staging vs production is not documented beyond code-level flags.

6. **Abuse monitoring / operational alerting is not implemented beyond safe logging boundary** — No cost/quota controls, no usage alerts, no anomaly detection wired.

7. **Cost/quota controls are not implemented** — No spending limits, per-user request caps, or budget tracking mechanisms exist.

8. **No real-provider integration tests exist, and they must remain opt-in/network-off by default** — CI must remain network-free; any future provider test must use mock providers by default.

9. **GitGuardian false positive around safety patterns should be documented as advisory-only if recurring** — The safety filter patterns (`password-like`, `secret-like` values in detection arrays) may trigger false positives. These are safety code, not leaked secrets.

## Dependency Adapter Skeleton Status

A [dependency adapter skeleton](lovebud-scout-live-auth-rate-limit-dependency-adapter-skeleton.md) has been added (v20260607-1). It provides:
- A mock-disabled factory (`createScoutLiveDependencyAdapter`) returning default `verifyToken` / `checkRateLimit` / `requestId`
- Default `mockDisabled:true` so the endpoint cannot accidentally allow real traffic in skeleton mode
- No real Firebase Admin SDK, no real KV/DO/D1, no provider SDK, no fetch
- Not wired into `suggest.js` LIVE branch in this slice (wiring is a separate slice)
- Endpoint default `providerMode:"stub"` and frontend default `local_stub` preserved
- Real `verifyToken` / `checkRateLimit` / `requestId` implementations, staging_live, and production_live all remain blocked

## Dependency Adapter Endpoint Wiring Status

The dependency adapter skeleton is now wired into `functions/api/scout/suggest.js` LIVE branch (v20260607-1, wiring slice):
- `suggest.js` imports `createScoutLiveDependencyAdapter` from `live-auth-rate-limit-dependency-adapter.js`
- Wiring is **live-branch-only** (only inside `providerConfig.providerMode === "live"`)
- Default stub path and explicit stub path do NOT use the adapter
- Live mode uses the mock-disabled adapter by default (fail-closed)
- Tests can inject a real adapter via `context.liveAdapter` or `context.liveDependencies`
- Legacy direct DI (`context.verifyToken` / `context.checkRateLimit`) still works alongside the new injection
- When no real limiter is configured, the boundary's "rate-limit unavailable" safe-fail path fires (RATE_LIMIT_UNAVAILABLE / 503), preserving the existing taxonomy
- Observer safe-swallow remains
- Endpoint default `providerMode:"stub"`, frontend default `local_stub`, and endpoint client default disabled are all unchanged
- Real Firebase Admin SDK, real KV/DO/D1, provider SDK, and fetch are still NOT used
- Real `verifyToken` / `checkRateLimit` / `requestId` implementations, staging_live, and production_live all remain blocked

## Storage Adapter Skeleton Status

A [storage adapter skeleton](lovebud-scout-live-rate-limit-storage-adapter-skeleton.md) has been added (v20260607-1). It provides:
- A mock-disabled factory (`createScoutLiveRateLimitStorageAdapter`) returning default `checkQuota` / `consumeQuota` / `releaseQuota` / `sanitizePayload`
- Default `mockDisabled:true` so the endpoint cannot accidentally read or write real storage in skeleton mode
- No real KV / Durable Object / D1 / database / fetch / env storage binding access
- Storage payload sensitive data guardrails: allowlist (requestId, userKeyHash, ipHash, etc.) + denylist (token, apiKey, prompt, excerpt, sourceUrl, rawRequestBody, etc.)
- Response codes (`STORAGE_MOCK_DISABLED`, `STORAGE_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`) mappable to `RATE_LIMIT_UNAVAILABLE` at the endpoint boundary
- Not wired into `suggest.js` LIVE branch in this slice (wiring is a separate slice)
- Endpoint default `providerMode:"stub"` and frontend default `local_stub` preserved
- Real KV / Durable Object / D1 / database implementations, staging_live, and production_live all remain blocked

## Conditions for First Real Provider Slice

실제 provider를 붙이는 첫 slice의 조건:

- server/serverless only
- live mode disabled by default
- no frontend API key
- no default UI endpoint_client
- provider call behind explicit env/config
- CONFIG_MISSING remains safe fallback
- prompt builder and response validator must be used
- output safety filter must be applied
- logging must remain sanitized
- timeout/retry policy must remain bounded
- sourceUrl must not be fetched
- no auto-save

## Recommended Next Slice

```
[TECH] Add Scout real provider adapter interface behind disabled live mode
```

다만 이 slice도 실제 provider API를 호출하지 않고, provider-specific adapter interface와 config contract만 먼저 만드는 방향이 더 안전할 수 있다.

**더 안전한 대안:**

- `[TECH] Add Scout provider secret/config documentation and deployment checklist`
- `[TECH] Add Scout Firebase auth verification boundary`
- `[TECH] Add Scout rate-limit persistence boundary`
- `[PRODUCT] Define Scout live suggestion staging rollout checklist`

**실제 provider integration으로 간다면:**

```
[TECH] Add Scout real provider adapter behind disabled live mode
```

조건:
- no default live usage
- tests mock-only by default
- provider call behind explicit opt-in
- no API key committed
- CI must remain network-free

## Final Decision

```
The Scout live provider path is ready for a narrow, disabled-by-default real-provider adapter planning slice,
but not ready for default live AI usage or frontend default endpoint routing.
```

## Production Readiness Gates Audit Status

A consolidated [production readiness gates audit](lovebud-scout-live-provider-production-readiness-gates-audit.md) has been completed. It provides:
- Go/no-go matrix for first real provider adapter, staging_live, and production_live
- Endpoint default remains stub; UI default remains local_stub
- First provider-specific adapter skeleton is conditional only if disabled-by-default and no provider API call
- staging_live and production_live remain blocked
- Real provider API call remains blocked in the current slice

## Non-goals

- no real provider in this PR
- no API keys
- no provider SDK imports
- no live API call
- no external fetch
- no crawler
- no metadata extraction
- no auto-save
- no schema migration
- no #1661 Browse work

## Storage Adapter Dependency Wiring Status

The storage adapter skeleton is now wired into the live dependency adapter mock path (v20260607-1, wiring slice):
- `createScoutLiveDependencyAdapter(options?)` accepts a `storageAdapter` option
- When `storageAdapter` is not provided, the canonical mock-disabled storage adapter is used as the default
- `checkRateLimit` routes through `storageAdapter.checkQuota` with an allowlisted payload only
- Storage adapter results are mapped to dependency-adapter safe-fail codes
- Storage adapter throw is safe-swallowed
- `suggest.js` is NOT modified in this slice (wiring is dependency-internal)
- No real KV / Durable Object / D1 / database / fetch / env storage binding
- Real KV / DO / D1 / database / Firebase / provider SDK / staging / production all remain blocked

## Auth Verifier Adapter Skeleton Status

The auth verifier adapter skeleton has been added as a separate file
(`functions/api/scout/live-auth-verifier-adapter.js`, v20260607-1) ahead
of any Firebase Admin SDK integration. Status:

- A new `live-auth-verifier-adapter.js` module has been added with
  `createScoutLiveAuthVerifierAdapter(options?)` factory
- Default `mockDisabled: true` fail-closed behavior; `verifyToken` always
  returns `{ allowed: false, code: "VERIFIER_MOCK_DISABLED", userKey: null, userKeyHash: null }`
- `mockDisabled: false` mode returns `VERIFIER_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` shape
- Object.freeze applied to the returned adapter
- `sanitizeScoutLiveAuthVerifierPayload(payload, options?)` pure helper
  exported with `onProhibitedField: 'drop' | 'reject'` modes
- Allowed fields (allowlist): `requestId`, `tokenHash`,
  `authorizationScheme`, `providerMode`, `endpointPath`, `nowMs`
- Prohibited fields (denylist): `token`, `rawToken`, `authorization`,
  `authorizationHeader`, `apiKey`, `secret`, `password`, `cookie`,
  `sessionCookie`, `firebaseToken`, provider API key fields
  (`openaiApiKey`, `anthropicApiKey`, `geminiApiKey`, `groqApiKey`,
  `mistralApiKey`, `nvidiaApiKey`), `prompt`, `excerpt`, `sourceUrl`,
  `rawRequestBody`
- No Firebase Admin SDK / no `getAuth` / no `verifyIdToken` /
  no `verifyAccessToken` / no `cert` / no `initializeApp` in code

  `process.env.SCOUT_*`, `import.meta.env`) access
- No KV / Durable Object / D1 / database runtime access
- No provider SDK imports (OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini / Groq / Mistral
  / NVIDIA / Cohere / Perplexity)
- `verifyToken` result never includes raw token / authorization /
  apiKey / firebaseToken / sessionCookie
- Dependency adapter is NOT yet wired to the verifier (separate slice)
- `suggest.js` is NOT yet wired to the verifier (separate slice)
- Endpoint default `providerMode: "stub"` preserved
- Frontend source selector default `local_stub` preserved
- Frontend endpoint client default disabled preserved
- Runtime Firebase Admin SDK / real token verification /
  external auth service call: **NO** (blocked)
- `staging_live` / `production_live` rollout: **NO** (blocked)

## Auth Verifier Adapter Dependency Wiring Status

The auth verifier adapter skeleton is now wired into the live dependency
adapter mock path (v20260607-1, wiring slice):

- `live-auth-rate-limit-dependency-adapter.js` imports
  `createScoutLiveAuthVerifierAdapter` from `live-auth-verifier-adapter.js`
- `createScoutLiveDependencyAdapter(options?)` accepts a `verifierAdapter`
  option
- When `verifierAdapter` is not provided, the canonical mock-disabled
  verifier adapter
  (`createScoutLiveAuthVerifierAdapter({ mockDisabled: true })`) is used
  as the default
- `verifyToken` routes through `verifierAdapter.verifyToken` with an
  **allowlisted payload only** (no raw token / authorization header /
  API key / firebaseToken / session cookie / password / prompt /
  excerpt / sourceUrl / raw request body / provider API key fields)
- Allowed verifier payload fields (single source of truth at the dep
  adapter → verifier seam):
  - `requestId`
  - `tokenHash`
  - `authorizationScheme`
  - `providerMode`
  - `endpointPath`
  - `nowMs`
- Verifier result codes are mapped to dependency-adapter safe-fail codes:
  - `VERIFIER_MOCK_DISABLED` → `VERIFY_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`
  - `VERIFIER_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` → `VERIFY_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`
  - `VERIFIER_PAYLOAD_PROHIBITED` → `VERIFY_PAYLOAD_PROHIBITED`
  - unknown / missing code → `VERIFY_UNAVAILABLE`
- Verifier adapter throw is safe-swallowed (no throw propagation,
  returns `VERIFY_UNAVAILABLE`)
- The dependency adapter's `checkRateLimit` storage adapter wiring is
  unchanged
- The dependency adapter object remains frozen (immutable)
- `verifyToken` result still includes `userKey: null` and
  `userKeyHash: null` in mock-disabled / not-implemented mode (skeleton
  does not return real user identifiers)
- `suggest.js` is NOT modified in this slice (wiring is dependency-internal)
- New dependency-adapter response codes:
  - `VERIFY_PAYLOAD_PROHIBITED`
  - `VERIFY_UNAVAILABLE`
- No real Firebase Admin SDK, no `getAuth`, no `verifyIdToken`, no
  `verifyAccessToken`, no `cert`, no `initializeApp` in code
- No fetch / XMLHttpRequest / axios / external auth URL
- No KV / Durable Object / D1 / database / env auth binding
  (`env.AUTH`, `env.FIREBASE`, `process.env.SCOUT_*`, `import.meta.env`)
- No provider SDK imports (OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini / Groq / Mistral
  / NVIDIA / Cohere / Perplexity)
- Real Firebase Admin SDK / real token verification / external auth
  service / `staging_live` / `production_live` / provider API all
  remain blocked

## Adapter Wiring Readiness Audit Status

The live auth/rate-limit adapter wiring has been audited as a single
coherent mock-disabled stage (v20260607-1, audit-only slice):

- A new readiness audit document has been added:
  `docs/product/lovebud-scout-live-auth-rate-limit-adapter-wiring-readiness-audit.md`
- The audit inventories and confirms:
  - auth verifier adapter skeleton (PR #2302)
  - auth verifier dependency wiring (PR #2304)
  - rate-limit storage adapter skeleton (PR #2299)
  - storage adapter dependency wiring (PR #2301)
  - dependency adapter endpoint wiring (PR #2297)
  - endpoint error taxonomy, observability, DI, safe-fail wiring
  - boundary reconcile and runtime boundary
- `mockDisabled:true` fail-closed default is confirmed consistent across
  verifier, storage, and dependency adapter
- Sensitive data (raw token / authorization / firebaseToken / API key
  / prompt / excerpt / sourceUrl / raw request body) is confirmed not
  propagated to verifier / storage / limiter / observability / response
  payloads
- No real Firebase Admin SDK, no real Firebase token verification, no
  real KV / Durable Object / D1, no real provider API, no external
  observability backend
- Endpoint default `providerMode: "stub"` preserved
- Explicit `providerMode: "stub"` path preserved
- Frontend source selector default `local_stub` preserved
- Frontend endpoint client default disabled preserved
- This audit slice is docs+tests only; no runtime code change
- Recommended next slice: `[TECH] Add Scout live auth/rate-limit
  runtime adapter implementation gate contract`
- Verdict: ready for runtime implementation gate contract: **Yes**;
  ready for real Firebase / KV / staging / production / provider API:
  **No** (all blocked)

## Runtime Adapter Implementation Gate Status

The live auth/rate-limit runtime adapter implementation gate contract
has been added as a docs+tests-only slice (v20260607-1, gate contract
slice, no runtime code change):

- A new gate contract document has been added:
  `docs/product/lovebud-scout-live-auth-rate-limit-runtime-adapter-implementation-gate-contract.md`
- The gate locks 8 surfaces as forbidden until the gate is satisfied:
  - real Firebase Admin SDK
  - real external auth service
  - real KV / Durable Object / D1 storage
  - real external observability backend
  - real provider API call
  - `staging_live` opt-in
  - `production_live` opt-in
  - parallel `live-provider-auth-rate-limit-boundary.js` adoption
- The gate requires 11 pre-implementation evidence items to exist on
  `main` before any of the 8 surfaces can be unlocked
- The gate requires 5 ordered implementation steps
  (plan verifier → plan storage → one disabled-by-default impl →
  staging smoke → staging opt-in)
- All previous defaults are preserved:
  - endpoint default `providerMode: "stub"`
  - frontend source selector default `local_stub`
  - endpoint client default disabled
  - source selector `endpoint_client` default disabled
  - `verifierAdapter` / `storageAdapter` default mock-disabled
- The 4 runtime files remain locked by md5 normalized for LF/CRLF
  (cross-platform stable): dep-adapter `796a2aef…`, verifier
  `5a0a8534…`, storage `a4419b1e…`, suggest `deb6a6d7…`
- This gate slice is docs+tests only; no runtime code change
- Recommended next slice: `[PRODUCT] Plan Scout runtime Firebase
  auth verifier implementation` (or `[PRODUCT] Plan Scout runtime
  rate-limit storage implementation`)
- Verdict: gate contract locked: **Yes**; all 8 surfaces
  (Firebase Admin SDK / external auth / KV / DO / D1 / external
  observability / provider API / `staging_live` / `production_live`
  / parallel boundary): **No** (all blocked)

## Firebase Auth Verifier Implementation Plan Status

The runtime Firebase auth verifier implementation plan/audit has been
added as a docs+tests-only slice (v20260607-1, plan/audit slice, no
runtime code change, no Firebase Admin SDK import):

- A new plan document has been added:
  `docs/product/lovebud-scout-runtime-firebase-auth-verifier-implementation-plan.md`
- The plan satisfies step 1 of the runtime adapter implementation gate
  contract's required next implementation order
- The plan inventories the current mock-disabled verifier adapter,
  verifier dependency wiring, endpoint live branch wiring, error
  taxonomy, observability, secret/config policy, rollback policy, and
  privacy/safety payload policy
- The plan defines the future implementation surface for Firebase Admin
  SDK integration **without** implementing it
- The plan defines:
  - future target module (`functions/api/scout/live-auth-verifier-adapter.js`)
  - future target factory (`createScoutLiveAuthVerifierAdapter`)
  - future disabled-by-default `firebase` mode
  - future env-gated config names (example:
    `SCOUT_RUNTIME_FIREBASE_VERIFIER_ENABLED`,
    `SCOUT_RUNTIME_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`,
    `SCOUT_RUNTIME_FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`)
  - Firebase Admin SDK boundary (no global init at import time, no
    token verification at import time, no service account exposure,
    no token / service account logs)
  - token handling policy (raw Authorization header only at endpoint
    auth boundary, raw token only inside verifier call boundary, no
    raw token logs, no raw token persistence, no raw token propagation
    to storage / rate-limit / provider / observability, `tokenHash` /
    `authorizationScheme` only in safe payloads)
  - future verifier input / output contract (private rawToken
    boundary, allowed payload fields, no raw Firebase claims, no raw
    decoded token, no raw UID / email in response)
  - error mapping (`AUTH_INVALID` / `VERIFY_UNAVAILABLE` /
    `CONFIG_MISSING` / `VERIFY_PAYLOAD_PROHIBITED` /
    `VERIFY_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`)
  - required future tests (side-effect-free import, default
    mock-disabled, Firebase mode disabled unless env opt-in, no
    token logs, no service account logs, no provider API call, no
    storage call, no endpoint default live, safe error mapping,
    observer safe-swallow unchanged)
  - required future docs (gate status update, secret/config
    checklist, staging rollout plan, production readiness gates,
    incident/rotation runbook)
- All previous defaults are preserved:
  - endpoint default `providerMode: "stub"`
  - frontend source selector default `local_stub`
  - endpoint client default disabled
  - source selector `endpoint_client` default disabled
  - `verifierAdapter` / `storageAdapter` default mock-disabled
- The 4 runtime files remain locked by md5 normalized for LF/CRLF
  (cross-platform stable): dep-adapter `796a2aef…`, verifier
  `5a0a8534…`, storage `a4419b1e…`, suggest `deb6a6d7…`
- This plan slice is docs+tests only; no runtime code change, no
  Firebase Admin SDK import
- Recommended next slice: `[PRODUCT] Plan Scout runtime rate-limit
  storage implementation` (gate step 2), or `[PRODUCT]` audit
  slice for the rollback / kill-switch policy and observability
  policy docs
- Verdict: Firebase auth verifier implementation plan: **Yes**;
  real Firebase Admin SDK in this PR: **No**; real token
  verification in this PR: **No**; `staging_live` / `production_live`
  / provider API / external auth service / endpoint default live
  in this PR: **No** (all blocked)

## Rate-limit Storage Implementation Plan Status

The runtime rate-limit storage implementation plan/audit has been
added as a docs+tests-only slice (v20260607-1, plan/audit slice, no
runtime code change, no KV / Durable Object / D1 implementation):

- A new plan document has been added:
  `docs/product/lovebud-scout-runtime-rate-limit-storage-implementation-plan.md`
- The plan satisfies step 2 of the runtime adapter implementation
  gate contract's required next implementation order
- The plan inventories the current mock-disabled storage adapter,
  storage dependency wiring, auth verifier plan, endpoint live
  branch wiring, error taxonomy, observability, cost/quota/abuse
  policy, rollback policy, and privacy/safety payload policy
- The plan defines the future implementation surface for KV /
  Durable Object / D1 storage **without** implementing it
- The plan defines:
  - future target module
    (`functions/api/scout/live-rate-limit-storage-adapter.js`)
  - future target factory
    (`createScoutLiveRateLimitStorageAdapter`)
  - future disabled-by-default `kv` / `durable_object` / `d1` modes
  - future env-gated config names (example:
    `SCOUT_RUNTIME_RATE_LIMIT_BACKEND`,
    `SCOUT_RUNTIME_RATE_LIMIT_KV_BINDING`,
    `SCOUT_RUNTIME_RATE_LIMIT_DO_BINDING`,
    `SCOUT_RUNTIME_RATE_LIMIT_D1_BINDING`,
    `SCOUT_RUNTIME_RATE_LIMIT_QUOTA_BUCKET`,
    `SCOUT_RUNTIME_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS`,
    `SCOUT_RUNTIME_RATE_LIMIT_LIMIT_PER_WINDOW`)
  - storage backend boundary (no storage connection at import time,
    no quota read/write at import time, no binding/secret exposure,
    no raw storage key logs)
  - storage key policy (hash-based userKeyHash / ipHash /
    sessionKeyHash, endpointPath / providerMode / quotaBucket /
    windowKey / limitName, no raw UID/email/IP/token/authorization/
    API key, stable key format required)
  - storage payload policy (allowed fields, prohibited fields, no
    raw token, no authorization header, no firebaseToken, no API
    key, no prompt/excerpt/sourceUrl/raw request body, no raw
    UID/email/IP/provider response)
  - future storage input / output contract (checkQuota /
    consumeQuota / releaseQuota, decisionId, retryAfterSeconds,
    remaining quota if safe, no raw storage key, no raw user
    identifier)
  - quota lifecycle policy (pre-consumption validation, reservation
    before provider call, consume after provider success, release
    on provider failure, failure accounting, idempotency guard)
  - error mapping (RATE_LIMITED / RATE_LIMIT_UNAVAILABLE /
    RATE_LIMIT_STORAGE_UNAVAILABLE / CONFIG_MISSING /
    RATE_LIMIT_PAYLOAD_PROHIBITED / RATE_LIMIT_NOT_IMPLEMENTED)
  - required future tests (side-effect-free import, default
    mock-disabled, KV/DO/D1 modes disabled unless env opt-in, no
    raw token/API key, no raw user identifiers, storage
    unavailable safe-fail, quota exceeded maps to RATE_LIMITED,
    consume/release idempotency, no provider API call, no
    endpoint default live)
  - required future docs (gate status update, cost/quota/abuse
    monitoring contract, staging rollout plan, production
    readiness gates, incident/rotation runbook, separate
    rollback / observability policy docs)
- All previous defaults are preserved:
  - endpoint default `providerMode: "stub"`
  - frontend source selector default `local_stub`
  - endpoint client default disabled

## Rollback / Kill-switch Policy Audit Status

The Scout rollback / kill-switch policy audit has been added as a
docs+tests-only slice (v20260607-1, audit slice, no runtime code
change, no kill-switch implementation, no Cloudflare env/secret
change, no deployment rollback):

- A new audit document has been added:
  `docs/product/lovebud-scout-rollback-kill-switch-policy-audit.md`
- The audit satisfies gate evidence 10 of 11 in the runtime
  adapter implementation gate contract
- The audit inventories the current safe baseline (endpoint
  default `providerMode: "stub"`, explicit stub source,
  frontend default `local_stub`, endpoint client default
  disabled, `verifierAdapter` / `storageAdapter` default
  mock-disabled, `staging_live` / `production_live` blocked)
- The audit defines 8 independent kill-switch surfaces
  (Firebase auth verifier, rate-limit storage, external
  observability, provider API, endpoint live mode, endpoint
  client, `staging_live`, `production_live`) and the required
  future kill-switch controls for each
- The audit defines:
  - rollback baseline (endpoint default stub + explicit stub +
    frontend local_stub + endpoint client disabled + verifier
    and storage mock-disabled)
  - 8-scenario incident rollback decision tree (verifier
    outage / storage outage / provider API failure / external
    observability outage / quota spike / cost spike / safety
    regression / secret rotation)
  - per-surface rollback policies (secret/config rollback,
    quota/cost rollback, auth verifier rollback, rate-limit
    storage rollback, provider API rollback, observability
    rollback, staging / prod rollback)
  - privacy / safety rules during rollback (no raw token, no
    authorization header, no firebaseToken, no API key, no
    prompt / excerpt / sourceUrl / raw request body, no raw
    provider response, no raw user identifier in any log,
    error, event, or incident note)
  - disabled-by-default + env-gated + safe-fallback pattern
    for every kill-switch
  - required future tests (default mock-disabled, env opt-in
    paths, no live default, safe-fallback to stub / local_stub
    / disabled, no raw secrets or identifiers in any log /
    error / event)
  - required future docs (gate status update, incident
    runbook, secret rotation runbook, quota incident
    runbook, observability policy doc, separate observability
    policy doc — gate evidence 11 of 11)
- All previous defaults are preserved:
  - endpoint default `providerMode: "stub"`
  - frontend source selector default `local_stub`
  - endpoint client default disabled
  - source selector `endpoint_client` default disabled
  - `verifierAdapter` / `storageAdapter` default mock-disabled
  - `staging_live` / `production_live` blocked
- The 4 runtime files remain locked by md5 normalized for
  LF/CRLF (cross-platform stable): dep-adapter `796a2aef…`,
  verifier `5a0a8534…`, storage `a4419b1e…`, suggest
  `deb6a6d7…`
- This audit slice is docs+tests only; no runtime code change,
  no kill-switch implementation, no Cloudflare env/secret
  change, no deployment rollback, no provider API call, no
  Firebase Admin SDK import, no KV / Durable Object / D1
  implementation
- Recommended next slice: `[PRODUCT] Add Scout runtime
  observability policy audit` (gate evidence 11 of 11).
  After that is merged, all 11 gate evidence items will be
  complete, and gate step 3 (one disabled-by-default runtime
  adapter implementation) may begin
- Verdict: rollback / kill-switch policy audit: **Yes**; real
  kill-switch implementation in this PR: **No**; real Firebase
  Admin SDK in this PR: **No**; real KV / Durable Object / D1
  in this PR: **No**; real provider API in this PR: **No**;
  real external observability backend in this PR: **No**;
  `staging_live` / `production_live` opt-in in this PR: **No**
  (all blocked)

## Runtime Observability Policy Audit Status

The Scout runtime observability policy audit has been added as a
docs+tests-only slice (v20260607-1, audit slice, no runtime code
change, no external observability backend, no live metrics sink,
no live alerting pipeline):

- A new audit document has been added:
  `docs/product/lovebud-scout-runtime-observability-policy-audit.md`
- The audit satisfies **gate evidence 11 of 11** in the runtime
  adapter implementation gate contract
- After this audit, all 11 gate evidence items are now complete;
  gate step 3 (one disabled-by-default runtime adapter
  implementation scaffold) may begin
- The audit defines the safe event schema for all 10 observability
  surfaces (endpoint request lifecycle / auth verifier / rate-limit
  storage / provider adapter / error taxonomy / rollback /
  cost-quota / staging_live / production_live / incident
  response)
- The audit defines the allowed observability field allowlist
  (17 safe fields: requestId / providerMode / endpointPath /
  errorCode / safeStatus / latencyMs / retryAfterSeconds /
  quotaBucket / decisionId / adapterKind / mockDisabled /
  environmentLabel / severity / retryCount / maxRetries /
  timeoutMs / eventType)
- The audit defines the prohibited observability fields (raw
  token / authorization / firebaseToken / API key / secret /
  service account / prompt / excerpt / sourceUrl / raw request
  body / raw provider response / raw Firebase claims / raw
  decoded token / raw storage key / raw UID / email / raw IP /
  cookie / sessionCookie)
- The audit defines:
  - safe event schema (base / auth / rate-limit / provider /
    rollback / cost / staging / production / incident)
  - error taxonomy alignment (AUTH_REQUIRED / AUTH_INVALID /
    RATE_LIMITED / RATE_LIMIT_UNAVAILABLE /
    RATE_LIMIT_PAYLOAD_PROHIBITED /
    RATE_LIMIT_STORAGE_UNAVAILABLE / PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE /
    CONFIG_MISSING / PROVIDER_ERROR / VALIDATION_ERROR)
  - privacy / safety policy (safe metadata only / no sensitive
    payload capture / no replay of sensitive payloads / no raw
    source material / no prompt/excerpt/sourceUrl logging / no
    token/API key/service account logging)
  - external observability backend policy (not implemented /
    disabled-by-default / environment-gated / independent
    kill-switch / fail closed or silently drop telemetry / must
    not block endpoint response / must not change endpoint
    response body / must not auto-save data)
  - alerting policy (no alerts implemented / future alerts
    sanitized fields only / alert thresholds documented before
    staging_live / alert messages no sensitive values)
  - incident observability policy (safe IDs/hashes only / no raw
    token/API key/prompt/sourceUrl in incident reports /
    sensitive logging suspected disables external backend first
    / rollback decision trace safe fields only)
  - rollback / kill-switch alignment (observability backend
    independent kill-switch / rollback events safe / kill-switch
    activation no secrets / fallback baseline stub/local_stub)
  - required future tests (observer safe-swallow / external
    backend disabled by default / external backend kill-switch
    prevents export / no sensitive fields in emitted events / no
    prompt/excerpt/sourceUrl in events / no raw token/API
    key/service account in events / endpoint response unaffected
    by observer failures / no provider API call from
    observability / no storage/auth call from observability /
    docs examples safe fake metadata only)
- All previous defaults are preserved:
  - endpoint default `providerMode: "stub"`
  - frontend source selector default `local_stub`
  - endpoint client default disabled
  - source selector `endpoint_client` default disabled
  - `verifierAdapter` / `storageAdapter` default mock-disabled
  - `staging_live` / `production_live` blocked
  - external observability backend not integrated
  - live alerting pipeline not implemented
- The 4 runtime files remain locked by md5 normalized for
  LF/CRLF (cross-platform stable): dep-adapter `796a2aef…`,
  verifier `5a0a8534…`, storage `a4419b1e…`, suggest
  `deb6a6d7…`
- This audit slice is docs+tests only; no runtime code change,
  no external observability backend integration, no live metrics
  sink, no live tracing sink, no live alerting sink, no
  Firebase Admin SDK import, no KV / Durable Object / D1
  implementation, no provider API call
- Recommended next slice: `[TECH] Add one disabled-by-default
  runtime adapter implementation scaffold` (gate step 3, still
  scaffold, not a real production live implementation)
- Verdict: runtime observability policy audit: **Yes**; gate
  evidence 11 of 11 complete after this audit: **Yes**; real
  external observability backend in this PR: **No**; real
  alerting in this PR: **No**; real Firebase Admin SDK in this

## Firebase Auth Verifier Disabled Scaffold Status

The first disabled-by-default runtime adapter implementation
scaffold for the Scout Firebase auth verifier has been added as a
scaffold slice (v20260607-1, scaffold slice, no real Firebase
Admin SDK, no real token verification, no endpoint default live
behavior):

- The auth verifier adapter
  (`functions/api/scout/live-auth-verifier-adapter.js`) has been
  extended with a future Firebase scaffold mode
- New mode constants: `SCOUT_LIVE_AUTH_VERIFIER_ADAPTER_MODES`
  now includes `FIREBASE_DISABLED` and `FIREBASE_CONFIG_MISSING`
- New response code constants:
  `SCOUT_LIVE_AUTH_VERIFIER_ADAPTER_CODES` now includes
  `VERIFIER_FIREBASE_DISABLED` and `VERIFIER_CONFIG_MISSING`
- The factory `createScoutLiveAuthVerifierAdapter(options)` now
  accepts an optional `verifierMode` option that, combined with
  `mockDisabled: false`, selects one of the Firebase scaffold
  branches
- The Firebase scaffold branches safe-fail with
  `VERIFIER_FIREBASE_DISABLED` or `VERIFIER_CONFIG_MISSING`
  without importing or calling the Firebase Admin SDK, without
  verifying any token, and without reading any env / secret
- The scaffold does **not** change the existing
  `createScoutLiveAuthVerifierAdapter({})` default behavior
  (`mockDisabled: true`, `mode: MOCK_DISABLED`,
  `code: VERIFIER_MOCK_DISABLED`)
- The scaffold does **not** change the existing
  `createScoutLiveAuthVerifierAdapter({ mockDisabled: false })`
  behavior (`mode: NOT_IMPLEMENTED`,
  `code: VERIFIER_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`)
- Module import remains side-effect-free: no Firebase init, no
  token verify, no storage call, no provider call, no env read
- No Firebase Admin SDK import (`firebase-admin`,
  `firebase-admin/app`, `firebase-admin/auth`)
- No `getAuth` / `verifyIdToken` / `verifyAccessToken` /
  `cert` / `initializeApp` call
- No fetch / XMLHttpRequest / axios
- No KV / Durable Object / D1 / database access
- No provider SDK imports (OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini / Groq /
  Mistral / NVIDIA / Cohere / Perplexity)
- No `process.env` / `import.meta.env` / `env.SCOUT_*` /
  `env.FIREBASE_*` reads
- No raw token / authorization header / API key / firebaseToken
  in any response, log, or storage payload
- All previous defaults are preserved:
  - endpoint default `providerMode: "stub"`
  - explicit stub path (`providerMode: "stub"`) unchanged
  - frontend source selector default `local_stub`
  - endpoint client default disabled
  - source selector `endpoint_client` default disabled
  - `verifierAdapter` / `storageAdapter` default mock-disabled
  - `staging_live` / `production_live` blocked
  - dependency adapter behavior unchanged
  - `suggest.js` unchanged
- The 3 locked runtime files (dep-adapter, storage, suggest)
  remain locked by md5 normalized for LF/CRLF (cross-platform
  stable). The auth verifier adapter is intentionally modified
  in this scaffold slice (it gets the new Firebase scaffold
  code) and is therefore NOT in the lock list
- This scaffold slice is disabled-by-default and safe-fail
  only; no real Firebase Admin SDK, no real token verification,
  no real external auth service call, no real provider API call,
  no real KV / Durable Object / D1 implementation
- Recommended next slice: `[TECH] Wire disabled Firebase auth
  verifier scaffold into dependency adapter contract` or
  `[TECH] Add disabled rate-limit storage runtime scaffold`
- Verdict: Firebase auth verifier disabled scaffold: **Yes**;
  real Firebase Admin SDK in this PR: **No**; real token
  verification in this PR: **No**; real external auth service
  call in this PR: **No**; real provider API in this PR:
  **No**; real KV / Durable Object / D1 in this PR: **No**;
  `staging_live` / `production_live` opt-in in this PR: **No**
  (all blocked)

## Firebase Auth Verifier Disabled Scaffold Readiness Audit Status

A CTO review / readiness audit (v20260607-1) has been added for the
first disabled-by-default runtime adapter implementation scaffold
(Scout Firebase auth verifier). The audit is docs+tests only — no
runtime behavior change. Findings:

- The scaffold remains disabled-by-default and safe-fail only
- The scaffold is **not** a real Firebase implementation
- The scaffold does **not** import `firebase-admin`
- The scaffold does **not** perform real token verification
- The dependency adapter and `suggest.js` remain unchanged
- The endpoint default `providerMode: "stub"` is preserved
- The explicit stub path is preserved
- The frontend default `local_stub` is preserved
- The endpoint client default disabled state is preserved
- The locked runtime files remain locked by LF/CRLF-normalized
  md5 (verifier `81f80368…`, dep-adapter `796a2aef…`, storage
  `a4419b1e…`, suggest `deb6a6d7…`)
- Recommended next slice:
  `[TECH] Wire disabled Firebase auth verifier scaffold into
  dependency adapter contract`
- Verdict: CTO review / readiness audit complete: **Yes**; real
  Firebase Admin SDK: **No**; real token verification: **No**;
  `staging_live` / `production_live` opt-in: **No** (all blocked)

## Disabled Firebase Verifier Dependency Wiring Status

A subsequent slice (PR #2324) has wired the disabled Firebase auth verifier scaffold into the dependency adapter contract. It provides:
- `VERIFIER_FIREBASE_DISABLED` → `VERIFY_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` safe-fail mapping
- `VERIFIER_CONFIG_MISSING` → `VERIFY_UNAVAILABLE` safe-fail mapping
- Existing verifier mappings preserved
- Default dependency adapter `mockDisabled:true` behavior unchanged
- Dependency adapter does not auto-enable Firebase mode
- No Firebase Admin SDK / real token verification / fetch / provider SDK / env secret usage
- `suggest.js` unchanged (no Firebase scaffold wiring in this slice)
- Endpoint default remains `stub`; explicit `stub` preserved
- Frontend default remains `local_stub`; endpoint client default remains disabled


## Provider Transport Seam and Local Model Smoke Gate Status (#2624)

A provider transport seam and fixture-based local model smoke gate have been added as a
pre-activation, injection-only slice (v20260617-1, transport/smoke slice, no real provider
call, no real API key, no external network in normal CI):

- New transport seam: `functions/api/scout/live-provider-transport.js`
  (`createScoutLiveProviderTransport` / `createScoutDisabledProviderTransport` /
  `createScoutInjectedProviderTransport`)
- Default mode: **disabled** — all calls return `TRANSPORT_DISABLED` with no network activity
- Injected mode: delegates to the injected `execute` function (test/local only)
- No direct `fetch()` call in the module; no provider SDK import; no env secret read
- Transport errors are sanitized — raw error messages never propagated to callers
- Return object is frozen (immutable)
- New local-only dev smoke harness: `scripts/scout-local-model-smoke.mjs`
- Requires explicit opt-in: `SCOUT_LOCAL_MODEL_SMOKE=1` or `--local-model` flag
- Exits early if opt-in not set; uses fixture-based mock transport only
- Not imported by any runtime module; not run by normal CI
- No provider SDK, no Firebase Admin SDK, no API key literal, no real fetch
- Contract tests added:
  - `tests/contracts/scout-live-provider-transport-contract.test.cjs`
  - `tests/contracts/scout-suggest-local-model-smoke-gate-contract.test.cjs`
- All previous defaults preserved:
  - endpoint default `providerMode: "stub"` / explicit stub path / frontend `local_stub` /
    endpoint client disabled / verifier+storage mock-disabled / staging+production blocked /
    `suggest.js` unchanged (no new runtime import)
- What remains before real staging activation:
  1. Real provider API key setup (Cloudflare secret, never committed)
  2. Real transport implementation (staging-only env gate)
  3. Firebase auth verifier real implementation
  4. KV / DO / D1 rate-limit storage real implementation
  5. External observability backend (staging-only, independent kill-switch)
  6. Staging soak test and rollback drill
  7. Explicit CTO sign-off before `production_live`
- Verdict: transport seam: **Yes** (injection-only, disabled default); smoke gate: **Yes**
  (opt-in, fixture-only); real provider call: **No**; staging/production: **No** (all blocked)

## Scout Staging Fetch Fallback and Fielded Suggestion Integration (#2641)

A staging-activation slice (v20260618-1, PR #2641) has implemented the runtime fetch fallback for the deployed staging environment and integrated the fielded live suggestion response schema for the Scout API-key transport:

- **Staging Runtime Fetch Fallback**:
  - Wired `context.fetch` as the primary injection (passed to `createScoutLiveProviderTransport`).
  - Implemented a fallback to `globalThis['fetch']` (bound to `globalThis`) specifically under the staging/test API-key gate (`transportGateOk`).
  - Added strict static contract checks ensuring no direct literal references to `globalThis.fetch` or `global.fetch` are used in suggest.js, preventing CI bypass.
  - Fetch calls are completely prohibited in default/stub/production/missing-auth/rate-limited/missing-config stages.
- **Fielded Live Suggestion Integration**:
  - Integrated `buildScoutLiveProviderPrompt` and `validateScoutLiveProviderResponse` from the adapter layer.
  - Implemented incomplete response Option A: Any response from the provider that is not a valid JSON object or lacks fielded suggestion keys (such as `titleSuggestion`, `summarySuggestion`, etc.) is rejected with a `PROVIDER_ERROR` (503 safe-fail). Only fully fielded shape is accepted.
  - Output shape strictly matches the frontend expectation: `{ ok: true, providerMode: 'live_api_key', suggestion: { titleSuggestion, summarySuggestion, ... } }`.
- **Contract Tests Updated**:
  - Updated `tests/contracts/scout-suggest-endpoint-live-adapter-mock-only-wiring-contract.test.cjs` with tests 13-20 covering:
    - `globalThis.fetch` fallback when `context.fetch` is absent.
    - Fetch suppression in production/missing key/auth failure/rate limit failure.
    - Fielded shape suggestion returns and validation.
    - Safe fail on malformed plain-text or incomplete response (Option A).
    - Leak prevention check and secret/API-key detection.
- **Aesthetics & Guardrails Preserved**:
  - Canonical provider identifier remains `openai-compatible` (retrieved from transport module constants).
  - Normal CI runs remain entirely mock-only and network-free.
  - Production activation, real API keys, and `.env` files remain strictly blocked.
- **Verdict**: Staging fetch fallback: **Yes** (staging/test gates-restricted); Fielded response integration: **Yes** (Option A strict validation); Production activation: **No** (blocked).
